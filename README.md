# sentiment-web-app
Web app allowing users to input text and see a sentiment classification made by a deep learning model, built with an LSTM neural network, trained on the [sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) (a dataset of 1.6 million tweets with labelled sentiment).

The web app, built using streamlit, can be reached at [https://sentiment-web-app.herokuapp.com/](https://sentiment-web-app.herokuapp.com/)

Data cleaning, pre-processing and analysis as well as training, testing and evaluation of the deep learning model can be found in the Jupyter notebook in this repo linked [here](https://github.com/LowkeyBBQ/sentiment-web-app/blob/master/twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb).
